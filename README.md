This is the README file for the PH_HW2.Rmd file.

PH_HW2.Rmd is an rmarkdown file to be run in RStudio. Upon opening the file in Rstudio, please run 
the sections of code sequentially. 

The first section's purpose is to load all the necessary packages. For any packages you do not have 
installed, please uncomment the install command and run this section. It is advised to run just this
section by itself to ensure all the needed packages are installed with their dependencies. 

The next sections should each load a function to be used in the MAIN sections at the end of the 
document. These sections do not need to be run individually, like the first section is advised to. 

The last sections, which is refered to as the MAIN sections generate the desired output. These
sections do not need to be run individually.

Each section of code and its description is in the PH_HW2.pdf file.
